        <p>After that, I had to research how to make the switches work with te existing code. After my research, I found that I had to add to my constraints to make them compatible. </p>

        <p>The if else statements hold code for different flags and subsiquently be displayed when their respective switch is flipped, which will be shown in the demo section. </p>
